# 3D Shape Generator

The 3D Shape Generator is a Java-based application that demonstrates the use of object-oriented principles, such as polymorphism and inheritance. It provides functionality for generating various 3D shapes (Sphere, Cylinder, and Cube), calculating their surface areas and volumes, and displaying their details.

## Features

- Generate random instances of 3D shapes (Sphere, Cylinder, Cube).
- Calculate and display the surface area and volume of each shape.
- Use polymorphism to process shapes uniformly through a common interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17**: Programming language.
- **Java Collections Framework**: For managing collections of shape objects.
- **Random**: To generate random shape parameters.

## Project Structure
org.example │ ├── ShapeGenerator.java # Abstract base class for all shapes ├── Sphere.java # Class representing a sphere ├── Cylinder.java # Class representing a cylinder ├── Cube.java # Class representing a cube └── Main.java # Main class with the main() method to create and test objects


## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Install Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later.
- A code editor or IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahominato/Surface-Area-and-Volume-of-3d-Shapes.git
```

### 2. Compile and Run the Application
Navigate to the project directory and compile the code using:
```bash
javac org/example/*.java
```
Run the application with:
```bash
java org.example.Main
```

### Usage
Once the application is running, it will:

Generate and create random Sphere, Cylinder, and Cube objects.
Display the surface area and volume of each generated shape.
